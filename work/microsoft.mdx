### Data Scientist
Contributor of the half-stack (backend+ML) Microsoft Norway with a model enriching a
**world-wide experience** as feature/context provider.

Since this semester my direct responsibilities extended to the prototyping 
of the ways our model could represent as a **stand-alone user experience**. 
I have taken over the **end-to-end deployment** of the experiemntal pipeline related
to the project. My current tech-stack:
- C#, .NET, Python
- JavaScript, React, Redux
