Yesterday, I realized that one who applies for a front-end developer position,
does not simply send a Word CV. 

Therefore, I had in mind to combine **Tailwind** which
is a modern way to style a project, with **MDX** to manage 
project and experience content easily.

Although, it seemed that a static site-builder such as *Astro*, would have been
the best for the job, it was not as error-prone to mix those 2 together.

What you look at is **built in NextJS**, and although I did not have time to deploy it,
you can see how to build a similar shiny CV in my repo [here](https://github.com/lynochka/next-cv).
